### Limitations & Ideas for future

- Mentor Machines was developed in three days - many things could be improved, such as:

- The quiz questions have been generated using ChatGPT separately, and inserted as static file. These could be generated dynamically.

- Learning topics are a fixed as dropdown. Instead of dropdown, this could be a text box where you could insert anything you’d like to learn.

- More AI tutors faces! With Ex-Human.
